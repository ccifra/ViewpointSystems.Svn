To create an extension package:

1) Under the folder \ext-src\data\ni-paths-LVNXG200DIR64\Addons\ create the installation folder hierarchy as follows:
	i) Inside of \Addons\ create a folder with your Company/Publisher name
		e.g., \Addons\NI
	ii) In the folder created in the previous step, create a folder with your Product name
		e.g., \Addons\NI\DAQmx
	iii) In the 'Product' folder, create a folder with a Module Name and -ext decoration, as follows:
		e.g., \Addons\NI\DAQmx\Base-ext
	iv) In the 'module-ext' folder, create a folder with the Package Version number
		e.g., \Addons\NI\DAQmx\Base-ext\2.0\

2) Copy your compiled .NET assemblies to the \Addons\<company>\<product>\<module-ext>\<version>\ folder created in step 1

3) Edit the \ext-src\control\control file
	a) Modify 'Description:' to include the text you would like to display in NI Package Manager when a user selects your package
	b) Modify 'DisplayName:' to include your product name
	c) Modify 'Eula:' to match the eula-company-license entered in the eula control file
	d) Modify 'Homepage:' to direct users to your company site
	e) Modify 'Maintainer:' to include your Company/Publisher name and contact email address (follow the provided template of 'Company <support@company.com>')
	f) Modify 'Package:' to include your company and product name
	g) (Optional) Modify 'Version:' to match your build/version number

3) Save changes to the control file
4) Run 'pack-ext.bat' script to create extension package
5) Copy resulting .nipkg file to the 'NIPKG for extensions\repo\' folder
